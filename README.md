# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance on six machine learning models algorithms on credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.   

## Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary
#### According to the results, for this particular model the algorithm the best performing algorithm is Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier with an accuracy score of and a F1 score of  0.93. Undersampling  is the least performing with an  accuracy score of 0. 54 and a F1 score of 0.56. I recommend to have another analyst recheck Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier and use it for analysis if no code or discrepancies are found.
